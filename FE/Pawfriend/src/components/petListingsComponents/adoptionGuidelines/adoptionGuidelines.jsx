          <h1>Adoption Guidelines</h1>
          <p>
            Before deciding to adopt a dog or cat, ask yourself if you're ready
            to take lifelong responsibility for the pet, including financially,
            in terms of living arrangements, and emotionally. Adoption should be
            a well-thought-out decision made with the full agreement of you,
            your family, and any others involved. Please consider carefully
            before contacting PawFriend about adoption. Ready to begin? Follow
            these steps:
            <br></br>
            <br></br> 1Ô∏è‚É£ Learn about the pet you wish to adopt on PawFriend‚Äôs
            website.
            <br></br>2Ô∏è‚É£ Contact the assigned Volunteer to get more information
            about the pet.
            <br></br>3Ô∏è‚É£ Participate in the adoption interview.
            <br></br>4Ô∏è‚É£ Prepare your home, sign adoption papers, and pay the
            adoption fee to bring your pet home.
            <br></br>5Ô∏è‚É£ Regularly update us on the pet‚Äôs condition, especially
            if any issues arise, to get timely advice.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>‚ùó Please Note: Only message one Volunteer in charge; do
            not message all of them. If the Volunteer hasn‚Äôt responded within a
            day, kindly message our Page. The interview may include personal
            questions, so please be patient! The adoption fee varies based on
            the pet‚Äôs condition when rescued and any medical services
            (vaccinations, spaying/neutering) they‚Äôve received. The fee helps
            cover previous medical expenses and supports the care of other
            animals in need. If you‚Äôre unable to continue caring for the pet,
            you must return them to PawFriend and not give them to someone else.
